### 🌱 Getting Grounded: Python Fundamentals

Let’s start with the building blocks—the essentials that make you fluent in Python. You’ll see: even if you’re new, the logic is friendly, and the syntax is welcoming!

#### 🧩 Variables: Your Data Containers

In Python, variables are like labeled jars that you fill with data.

```python
# Let's save your name in a variable
my_name = "Jordan"
print("Hello,", my_name)
```

- No need to declare types (`str`, `int`, etc.). Python decides for you!
- Variable names should be descriptive and use underscores for spaces.
- Use `print()` to see what's inside your jars.

#### 1️⃣ Basic Data Types

- **Numbers**: `int`, `float`
- **Text**: `str` (strings)
- **Bool**: `True`, `False`

```python
age = 28                # int
temperature = 20.5      # float
greeting = "Hi there!"  # str
is_active = True        # bool
```

#### 🔘 Lists, Tuples & Dictionaries: Storing Collections

**Lists:** An ordered, changeable collection

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
print(colors[1])  # Output: green
colors.append("yellow")
```

**Tuples:** Like lists, but unchangeable (immutable)

```python
dimensions = (1920, 1080)
```

**Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs

```python
person = {"name": "Jordan", "age": 28}
print(person["name"])
```

### 🚦 Flow Control: Directing the Action

#### `if` Statements & Loops

Decide what happens—when!

```python
score = 87
if score > 90:
    print("Excellent!")
elif score > 70:
    print("Good job!")
else:
    print("Keep trying!")
```

**Loops:** Automate repetition

```python
for color in colors:
    print("I like", color)
```

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Counting:", count)
    count += 1
```

---

### 🎵 Functions: Your Custom Actions

Functions help you reuse code and break problems into steps.

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alex"))
```

- Use `def` to create a function.
- Use `return` to output a result.
- Call functions with parentheses.

---

### 🗄️ Data Storage Approaches

#### ⏳ In-Memory: Fast, Simple

- Use lists, dictionaries, or sets.
- Best for small, temporary tasks.

#### 💾 Files: Saving Data for Later

Write to a file:

```python
with open("hello.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

Read from a file:

```python
with open("hello.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

#### 🔢 CSV, JSON, and Beyond

- `.csv` for spreadsheets
- `.json` for structured data (used in APIs and configs)

```python
import json
person_dict = {"name": "Jordan", "city": "Berlin"}
with open("person.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(person_dict, file)

with open("person.json") as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    print(data["city"])
```

### 🛠️ Development Workflows: Professional and Practical

#### 🚀 Virtual Environments: Isolate Your Projects

Keep dependencies tidy and avoid conflicts!

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install packages locally (for your project):

```bash
pip install requests
```

Freeze requirements for easy sharing:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

#### 📝 Code Organization and Project Structure

```
myproject/
│
├── main.py
├── utils.py
├── requirements.txt
└── data/
    └── input.csv
```

- Keep files small and focused.
- Use folders for data, scripts, and tests.

#### 🧹 Linting and Formatting

Let’s keep code clean and readable! Use tools like `black` and `flake8`:

```bash
pip install black flake8
black main.py
flake8 main.py
```

#### 🧪 Testing: Your Safety Net

Write simple *unit tests* to check your code:

```python
# test_greet.py
from main import greet

def test_greet():
    assert greet("Sam") == "Hello, Sam!"
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest test_greet.py
```

#### 🔁 Version Control (Git) Essentials

Track your progress—and share safely!

```bash
git init
git add main.py
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

- Commit often, with clear messages.
- Learn to `push` to remote repositories (like GitHub) to back up or collaborate.
