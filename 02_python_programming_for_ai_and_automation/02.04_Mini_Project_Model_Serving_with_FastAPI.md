### 🚀 Mini Project: Model Serving with FastAPI

Ready to bring everything you’ve learned to life? In this mini project, you’ll discover how to turn a Python machine learning model into a web service that can be accessed from anywhere. We’ll use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)—a lightning-fast, modern web framework loved by data scientists and devs alike.

By the end, you’ll:
- Wrap a machine learning model with FastAPI.
- Send it data via an HTTP request.
- Receive predictions instantly, just like a real-world AI application.

#### 1️⃣ What is Model Serving? 🤔

Imagine you’ve trained a machine learning model—a spam detector, a price predictor, or a recommendation engine. But how do you share its intelligence with the world?

**Model serving** is the answer: Hosting your model so anyone (or any app) can send it data and get back predictions via a web API.

---

#### 2️⃣ Meet FastAPI: Your AI’s Gateway to the World 🌐

**Why FastAPI?**
- Super easy to use and read.
- As fast as NodeJS or Go for production workloads.
- Built-in docs—try your API in the browser!

Let’s get started.

---

#### 3️⃣ Set Up Your Environment 🔧

First, let’s install what we need:

```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn
```

- `fastapi`: For the API.
- `uvicorn`: FastAPI’s lightning-fast server.
- `scikit-learn`: Our ML model toolkit.

---

#### 4️⃣ Train a Simple ML Model (Locally) 🧑‍💻

For this demo, let’s use scikit-learn to whip up a basic Iris flower classifier.

```python
# train_and_save_model.py

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import pickle

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Save the model to reuse in FastAPI
with open("iris_model.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
```

Run this script once. You’ll get an `iris_model.pkl` file—our trained model!

---

#### 5️⃣ Serve the Model with FastAPI 🚦

Now, let’s create an API to serve predictions!

```python
# main.py

import pickle
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Load the model
with open("iris_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

app = FastAPI(title="Iris Classifier API 🌸")

# Define the data schema for input
class IrisFeatures(BaseModel):
    sepal_length: float
    sepal_width: float
    petal_length: float
    petal_width: float

@app.post("/predict")
def predict(features: IrisFeatures):
    data = [[
        features.sepal_length, 
        features.sepal_width, 
        features.petal_length, 
        features.petal_width
    ]]
    prediction = model.predict(data)
    return {"prediction": int(prediction[0])}
```

**Key Parts:**
- `IrisFeatures`: Defines what data callers must send.
- `/predict`: Accepts POST requests with flower measurements, returns a class prediction.

---

#### 6️⃣ Start Your API 🏃‍♂️

Fire up your model server:

```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- Open your browser at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for interactive API docs! 🎉

---

#### 7️⃣ Test It Out! 🧪

You can **try the API right from your browser**:

- Go to `/docs`.
- Click `POST /predict`.
- Enter:
  ```json
  {
    "sepal_length": 5.1,
    "sepal_width": 3.5,
    "petal_length": 1.4,
    "petal_width": 0.2
  }
  ```

Or use `curl` in your terminal:

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"sepal_length":5.1,"sepal_width":3.5,"petal_length":1.4,"petal_width":0.2}'
```

You’ll receive:
```json
{"prediction":0}
```

#### 8️⃣ Next Steps & Challenge Yourself 🎯

- **Security:** Add authentication to protect your model.
- **Deploy:** Try deploying to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), or [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/).
- **Real-Time Apps:** Connect your FastAPI server to a web or mobile app!
