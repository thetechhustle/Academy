Welcome to your capstone preparation and Lightning Demo Day guide! 🚀 This is where everything you’ve learned comes together—where theory turns into practice and practice shines in the spotlight. Whether you’re automating a work report, building a client onboarding system, or creating an AI-infused to-do list, this is your chance to showcase your skills and build confidence for real-world impact.

### 1. Capstone Project Planning 🗺️

Before you dive in, let’s get clear on your project’s purpose and scope.

#### Reflect & Choose

- **Who are you helping?** (Colleagues? Customers? Yourself?)
- **What problem will you solve with automation or no-code tools?**
- **Why is it worth automating?** (Time savings, error reduction, increased productivity, etc.)

👉 Example:
> “I’m streamlining our team’s weekly report emails, which currently take 3 hours to compile. With a Zapier workflow and Google Sheets, I’ll compress that task into 15 minutes!”

### 2. Storyboard Your Workflow 🎨

A clear plan prevents confusion later.

#### Steps:
- **Map the workflow** (sketched diagram or bullet list):
    1. Trigger: Form submission (Google Forms)
    2. Data logs to Google Sheets
    3. Automation: Zapier sends a summary email to the team
    4. (Bonus) Integrate ChatGPT to summarize responses

##### Simple Markdown Diagram
```markdown
Form Submission (Google Forms)
          ↓
   Google Sheets Row
          ↓
  [Zapier Trigger]
          ↓
 Team Email + AI Summary (via OpenAI API)
```

### 3. Build Your Automation (With Example!) 🛠️

Let’s bring it to life. Below is a pseudo-code workflow for integrating Google Sheets, Zapier, and OpenAI’s API—all using no-code tools.

#### Step-by-Step Example: Auto-Summary Email Bot

1. **Trigger:** New row in a project update sheet.
2. **Zapier Action:** Format a prompt for OpenAI:
    ```
    Prompt: "Summarize the following weekly updates for the team:"
    Data: [Column values from new row]
    ```
3. **Zapier Action:** Call OpenAI (using Zapier’s OpenAI integration).
4. **Zapier Action:** Send output to Gmail; CC team.

##### Mocked Zapier-style Logic (Pseudocode)
```python
# Pseudocode for Conceptual Understanding
when new_row_in_google_sheet:
    update_text = extract_sheet_update(row)
    summary = openai.summarize(update_text)
    send_email(to=team, body=summary)
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** Most no-code tools let you test each step before going live. Use test data!

### 4. Preparing for Demo Day ⚡

Now, it’s time to get ready to showcase your work. Remember: confidence comes from clarity and practice.

#### Demo Flow:

1. **Brief intro** (30 seconds): “My challenge was...”
2. **Live run-through** (2–3 minutes):
    - Show the workflow in action (record a screencast if you’re nervous!)
    - Describe the core steps (“When I submit this form, Zapier detects it and triggers these next steps…”)
3. **Highlight the impact**:
    - “This cut email prep from 3 hours to 15 minutes weekly!”
    - “Our team can now focus on big ideas instead of repetitive admin.”
4. **Q&A**: Be ready to answer what you learned, challenges you faced, and improvement ideas.

### 5. Telling Your Automation Story 🎤

- **Frame for your resume:** “Designed and deployed automated workflow with Zapier + AI, reducing repetitive reporting by 85%.”
- **Share on LinkedIn/GitHub:** Add project screenshots, flow diagrams, or even a narrated video demo.
